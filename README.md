## Getting Started
Welcome to the team! To get started working on this project, you will have to do some initial environment setup. All developers will need their local environment to include:
    
### Environment
* Eclipse (for Java/JavaScript/HTML)
* JDK 8
* Apache Tomcat 8 (for local testing)
* Git CLI (for working with the repo)

Once your environment is setup you can clone the repo and import in into Eclipse to start developing.


### Working with the Repo
To keep the pipeline consistent all developers must follow the same workflow when it comes to working with the repo. In some cases, the lead developer will assign you a user story
to work on, and in other cases you may freely pick up an open issue. In either case the repo work flow will be the same.
1. Checkout the development branch
2. Pull any changes from that branch
3. Create a feature branch
    * The branch name should be the name of your issue or user story (like hotfix-28 or RS-17)
    * Immediately create a merge request for your new branch.
        * Source branch should be your new hotfix or issue branch
        * Target branch should be development branch
4. Do your development thing in your new branch
5. When finished or at a stopping point
    * Commit and push your changes
6. When you have completed your development commit and push your changes with the commit message "Ready for final inspection"
7. Your code will be reviewed for a final time and the merge request will be accepted or denied for fixes.
